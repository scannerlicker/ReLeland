# ReLeland music fonts

This repository contains the **ReLeland music font, Version 0.1**.

## About the fonts

ReLeland is a drag-and-drop redrawing -- mostly a cleanup, of the Leland music font (Leland), Version 0.1 are available in Type 1, OpenType-CFF format and UFO. As the original, it is distributed under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL), Version 1.1](./LICENSE.txt).

Leland has been initially developed for MuseScore Studio (https://www.musescore.org) music composition software.

ReLeland is compliant with [Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL)](https://w3c.github.io/smufl/), which provides a standard way of mapping the thousands of musical symbols required by conventional music notation into the Private Use Area in Unicode's Basic Multilingual Plane for a single (format-independent) font.

The font is named after [Leland Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Smith), creator of the [SCORE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCORE_(software)) music notation software.
